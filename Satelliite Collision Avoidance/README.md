#  Satellite Collision Avoidance System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project is a **prototype** of a Satellite Collision Avoidance System designed to predict potential satellite collisions in space and trigger preventive actions.  
It demonstrates how **data preprocessing, machine learning models, and dashboards** can be used to simulate real-time space safety monitoring.  

---

## ⚡ Problem Statement  
With the rising number of satellites in orbit, the risk of **satellite collisions** is increasing. Currently, there is no highly efficient system to monitor and predict such collisions with accuracy.  
Our system aims to:  
- Collect satellite positional data.  
- Preprocess and analyze the data.  
- Predict possible collisions.  
- Display alerts and safe maneuver suggestions on a **dashboard**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.7+**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data handling)  
- **Scikit-learn / ML Models** (Prediction)  
- **Flask / Streamlit / Dash** (Interactive dashboard)  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** (Visualization)
